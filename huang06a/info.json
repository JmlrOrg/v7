    "abstract": "The Bradley-Terry model for obtaining individual skill from paired\ncomparisons has been popular in many areas.  In machine learning, this\nmodel is related to multi-class probability estimates by coupling all\npairwise classification results. Error correcting output codes (ECOC)\nare a general framework to decompose a multi-class problem to several\nbinary problems. To obtain probability estimates under this framework,\nthis paper introduces a generalized Bradley-Terry model in which\npaired individual comparisons are extended to paired team comparisons.\nWe propose a simple algorithm with convergence proofs to solve the\nmodel and obtain individual skill. Experiments on synthetic and re al\ndata demonstrate that the algorithm is useful for obtaining\nmulti-class probability estimates. Moreover, we discuss four\nextensions of the proposed model: 1) weighted individual skill, 2)\nhome-field advantage, 3) ties, and 4) comparisons with more than two\nteams.",
