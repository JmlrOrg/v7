    "abstract": "Spam filtering poses a special problem in text categorization, of\nwhich the defining characteristic is that filters face an active\nadversary, which constantly attempts to evade filtering. Since spam\nevolves continuously and most practical applications are based on\nonline user feedback, the task calls for fast, incremental and robust\nlearning algorithms. In this paper, we investigate a novel approach to\nspam filtering based on adaptive statistical data compression\nmodels. The nature of these models allows them to be employed as\nprobabilistic text classifiers based on character-level or binary\nsequences. By modeling messages as sequences, tokenization and other\nerror-prone preprocessing steps are omitted altogether, resulting in a\nmethod that is very robust. The models are also fast to construct and\nincrementally updateable. We evaluate the filtering performance of two\ndifferent compression algorithms; dynamic Markov compression and\nprediction by partial matching. The results of our empirical\nevaluation indicate that compression models outperform currently\nestablished spam filters, as well as a number of methods proposed in\nprevious studies.",
