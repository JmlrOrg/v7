    "abstract": "We present Variable Influence Structure Analysis, or VISA, an\nalgorithm that performs hierarchical decomposition of factored\nMarkov decision processes.\nVISA uses a dynamic Bayesian network model of actions, and\nconstructs a causal graph that captures relationships between\nstate variables.\nIn tasks with sparse causal graphs VISA exploits structure by\nintroducing activities that cause the values of state variables\nto change.\nThe result is a hierarchy of activities that together represent a\nsolution to the original task.\nVISA performs state abstraction for each activity by\nignoring irrelevant state variables and lower-level activities.\nIn addition, we describe an algorithm for constructing compact\nmodels of the activities introduced.\nState abstraction and compact activity models enable VISA\nto apply efficient algorithms to solve the stand-alone subtask\nassociated with each activity.\nExperimental results show that the decomposition introduced by\nVISA can significantly accelerate construction of an optimal, or\nnear-optimal, policy.",
