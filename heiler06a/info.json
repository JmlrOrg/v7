    "abstract": "We exploit the biconvex nature of the Euclidean non-negative matrix\nfactorization (NMF) optimization problem to derive optimization\nschemes based on sequential quadratic and second order cone\nprogramming.  We show that for ordinary NMF, our approach performs\nas well as existing state-of-the-art algorithms, while for\nsparsity-constrained NMF, as recently proposed by P. O. Hoyer in\n<i>JMLR 5 (2004)</i>, it outperforms previous methods.  In addition,\nwe show how to extend NMF learning within the same optimization\nframework in order to make use of class membership information in\nsupervised learning problems.",
