    "abstract": "An ensemble is a group of learning models that jointly solve a\nproblem. However, the ensembles generated by existing techniques are\nsometimes unnecessarily large, which can lead to extra memory usage,\ncomputational costs, and occasional decreases in effectiveness. The\npurpose of ensemble pruning is to search for a good subset of ensemble\nmembers that performs as well as, or better than, the original\nensemble. This subset selection problem is a combinatorial\noptimization problem and thus finding the exact optimal solution is\ncomputationally prohibitive. Various heuristic methods have been\ndeveloped to obtain an approximate solution. However, most of the\nexisting heuristics use simple greedy search as the optimization\nmethod, which lacks either theoretical or empirical quality\nguarantees. In this paper, the ensemble subset selection problem is\nformulated as a quadratic integer programming problem. By applying\nsemi-definite programming (SDP) as a solution technique, we are able\nto get better approximate solutions. Computational experiments show\nthat this SDP-based pruning algorithm outperforms other heuristics in\nthe literature. Its application in a classifier-sharing study also\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of the method.",
