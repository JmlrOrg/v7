    "abstract": "We describe anytime search procedures that (1) find disjoint subsets\nof recorded variables for which the members of each subset are\nd-separated by a single common unrecorded cause, if such exists; (2)\nreturn information about the causal relations among the latent factors\nso identified. We prove the procedure is point-wise consistent\nassuming (a) the causal relations can be represented by a directed\nacyclic graph (DAG) satisfying the Markov Assumption and the\nFaithfulness Assumption; (b) unrecorded variables are not caused by\nrecorded variables; and (c) dependencies are linear. We compare the procedure with\nstandard approaches over a variety of simulated structures and sample sizes, and\nillustrate its practical value with brief studies of social science\ndata sets. Finally, we consider generalizations for non-linear\nsystems.",
